Welcome to biolearn's documentation!
====================================

`biolearn` library provides two different implementations of unsupervised
neural networks with biological-inspired learning rules.
The models are both based on neurons competiton and they are mathematically
described in the following papers:

-  D. Krotov, J. Hopfield,
   `Unsupervised Learning by Competing Hidden Units <https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10181>`__

-  G. Castellani et al.,
   `Solutions of the BCM learning rule in a network of lateral interacting nonlinear neurons <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10378187/>`__
