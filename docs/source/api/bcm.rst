BCM
---

**BCM class** : 
it inherits from `Base` class and implements the unsupervised neural network
based on the BCM learning rule.
Notice that the model has some specific parameters to set the lateral
interaction strength between neurons or to force the synaptic weights vectors to be orthogonal.
